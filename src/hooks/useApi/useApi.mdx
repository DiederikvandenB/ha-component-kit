# useApi()
This hook is designed to make it easy to make api calls programmatically.

This is a memoized wrapper for the [callService()](/docs/hooks-usehass-callservice--docs) helper from [useHass()](/docs/hooks-usehass--docs) to make it
easier to trigger services programmatically.

**Note:** There's extensive types available for typescript developers to make it very easy to develop and call actions with the available types for different
services, if a service isn't available in the types or the params are different / incorrect to what you're expecting you can extend these [here](/docs/advanced-extend-api--docs).


### Example Usage

```ts
import { HassConnect, useApi } from 'ha-component-kit';
function UseApiExample() {
  const lightService = useApi('light');
  return <button onClick={() => lightService.toggle('light.some_light_entity')} >TOGGLE LIGHT</button>
}
function App() {
  return <HassConnect hassUrl="http://localhost:1234">
    <UseApiExample />
  </HassConnect>
}

```
