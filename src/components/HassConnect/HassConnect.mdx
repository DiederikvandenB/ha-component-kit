# Description
This component will show the Home Assistant login form you're used to seeing normally, once logged in you shouldn't see
this again unless you clear device storage, once authenticated it will render the child components of HassConnect and provide access to the api.

### HassConnect Example

This is a top level component that takes care of the Authentication logic for you and all you have to do is login like you normally would.

<i><b>Note: </b>You will have to login on each device as HassConnect will store tokens per device.</i>

<Source language="ts" code={`
<HassConnect hassUrl="http://homeassistant.local:1234">
    // this will only render when authentication has passed
    <SomeComponent />
</HassConnect>
`} />
