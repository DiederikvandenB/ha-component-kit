# Overview

This package is designed to be a template for creating custom dashboards for Home Assistant using react.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ha-component-kit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ha-component-kit)

It provides components for you to use to create your own custom dashboard.

This is still a **WIP** and is subject to change, I will be making changes to this over the next few months to have a workable solution for multiple dashboards.

Icons: [@iconify/react"](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/react/) to have a wide range of available svg icons available

You must install the following peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i react react-dom home-assistant-js-websocket
```

### Get Started

### Local Development / Contribution
