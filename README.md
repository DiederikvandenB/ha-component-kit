# Overview

This package is designed to be a template for creating custom dashboards for Home Assistant using react.

It provides components for you to use to create your own custom dashboard.

This is still a **WIP** and is subject to change, I will be making changes to this over the next few months to have a workable solution for multiple dashboards.

It has 0 package dependencies, however you must install the following peer dependencies:

```bash
npm i react react-dom home-assistant-js-websocket
```

### Get Started

There's a detailed [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) which should give you all the information you need to get started.


### Local Development / Contribution
To spin up the local server, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
npm i && npm start
```
