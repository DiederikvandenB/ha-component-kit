### Get Started

There's extensive [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) which should give you all the information you need to get started!

### Local Development / Contribution
To spin up the local server, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
npm i && npm start
```

This will kick off the storybook server, which will allow you to develop and test components locally with the storybook demo pages.
